AutoPC software

# branch main

The main branch of the repo can do all the analysis and generate a combinational ckt for simulation.
Subsequently, the main the branch has files to process the simulated data.

# sqckt branch

This branch contained the optimised hardware that can be implemented on an FPGA platform. This branch code will enable the generation of the same results as shown in the paper.

# UPDATE

Still, lot of explanation on how to run the software for combinational and FPGA CKTs will be added in the coming weeks.
