For this component, three different adder designs are considered when performing quire addition:
* Ripple-carry adder
* Brent-Kung adder
* Kogge-Stone adder

While the former is implemented by default with common synthesis tools, the other two have explicit designs, which are obtained from [github.com/albertodbg/vhdl-arithmetic](https://github.com/albertodbg/vhdl-arithmetic) repository.
